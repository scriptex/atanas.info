## Summary

CityJS Athens 2025, held from May 28 to 31 at the Serafio Community Center, brought together JavaScript enthusiasts for two days of intensive workshops followed by a two-day conference. The event featured over 30 speakers and covered a wide array of topics, from modern testing practices to web performance optimization and AI integration.

It was my first time in Athens, Greece and I have to say that it's something I will remember - both with the experience from the conference and with the city vibes.

I got to meet Douglas Crockford - the father of JSON, got the change to talk to him and listen to his wise words.

Athens is a beautiful city - there are olive, orange, tangerine, lime and lemon trees everywhere, the food is fantastic and the people are so warm and welcoming. I will definitely come back!

## Schedule

The web offered and offers us an incredible promise, a lush and tangled jungle of art, writing, businesses and weirdos growing in different directions, together. A space where you could build and grow something that was yours. But some of the trends we’re seeing today: the dominance of large closed platforms, ubiquitous data grabs and the torrents of empty AI content being sprayed across the web, feel like they’re clear-cutting the promise of the web.

Together, let’s explore some of the challenges facing the web today, alongside the small and large things we can do to push back against them. During this exploration, let’s also take time to push against our own expectations of the web we have today and marvel at the pockets of beautiful, powerful weirdness where the seeds of our shared hopes flourish today.

Her talk felt a bit nostalgic - she discussed the history of the web, how it was used and how it evolved. She showed some old, silly, fun-looking websites and talked about the concept of publishing on the web. Then she moved on to how the web evolved to be an AI-generated slop.

![10:35 Faris Aziz | Small PDF - Engineering Without a Safety Net: Where It Works and Where It Hurts](/images/blog/cityjs-athens-2025/3.jpeg)

Testing, monitoring, observability. They’re rarely urgent, often skipped, and easy to dismiss when things are moving fast. But what’s the real cost of deferring them, and how much can you actually get away with?

This talk explored the tradeoffs of skipping traditional engineering practices in the name of speed, and what happens when you try to layer them in after a system has already scaled. It’s not about dogma or checklists, it’s about pragmatism, risk, and timing.

Faris highlighted the critical importance of testing in software development. He pointed out that many companies still neglect testing, which serves as a safety net. The talk emphasized the need for standardized approaches, the significance of metrics and continuous monitoring, and the challenges faced before implementing test automation. Key topics included feature flags, cyclomatic complexity, and the maintenance of test codebases.

Fun fact: Faris is a rubber duck fan and he also brought two ducks with him - one yellow and one red.

![11:30 Mesut Durukal | Indeed - Scaling Test Automation: Building Reusability for 10x Speed and Efficiency](/images/blog/cityjs-athens-2025/4.jpeg)

Background — As a test automation engineer at Indeed, he focuses on testing job boards that share common components, such as search functionality. When he started working on one job board, he quickly recognized a significant opportunity to improve test automation across multiple teams and applications. He proposed a solution to make the test automation framework reusable and scalable across the organization. This approach has revolutionized how one approaches automation, reducing test implementation time and increasing collaboration.

Problem Statement — In large organizations, teams often face two main challenges when scaling test automation:

- Lack of Collaboration and Holistic Testing: Testing is siloed, with different teams tackling similar technical challenges in isolation. Developers and other roles aren't always involved in testing, making it difficult to foster a holistic quality mindset across the organization.
- Duplication and Inefficiency: Multiple teams work on automating the same or similar components, such as a search bar, but often take different approaches. This leads to inefficiencies, duplicated efforts, and inconsistency in test strategies.

The need for a reusable and scalable test automation framework is clear, but the question is: how can we implement it effectively and ensure it benefits all teams, applications, and environments?

Solution — Mesut's team developed a centralized test automation framework designed to be scalable and reusable across teams and applications. The framework addresses common problems like duplication of efforts, inefficiencies, and inconsistency in testing strategies by providing a shared platform for test automation. Key components of the framework include:

- Test Runner: To handle running tests efficiently in different environments.
- Parallelization: Both locally and remotely, at the spec and test levels, speeding up execution.
- Retries: At both the test level and for failing requests, reducing flakiness.
- Test Reporter: Providing isolated test execution details for better reporting.
- Configuration Management: Allowing for easy adjustment of execution parameters.
- Execution Metrics Collection: Tracking key metrics like success rate, flakiness, and test duration.

This framework enables teams to quickly implement tests and share solutions, reducing redundancy and ensuring high-quality, maintainable automation.

Key Takeaways — Attendees of this session learned:

- How to scale test automation across different teams and applications without compromising quality.
- Strategies to improve test reusability, reducing duplication of effort.
- Methods for addressing flakiness and improving test reliability.
- Approaches to monitoring and maintaining a central framework, with key insights into tracking execution metrics.
- How to reduce test implementation time from 5 hours to 30 minutes through efficient, reusable practices.

Outline:

- Introduction (25%): Problem definition, emphasizing the benefits of a reusable and distributed test framework.
- Strategy (30%): Key considerations for building a scalable and reusable test automation framework.
- Framework Architecture (15%): Overview of the key components (test runner, parallelization, retries, etc.).
- Monitoring & Maintenance (15%): How to track execution metrics and maintain quality.
- Summary & Q&A (15%): Recap and open floor for audience questions.

How This Talk is Different — This talk is more than just a technical deep dive into test automation frameworks. It's a practical, experience-based report on how to scale test automation efforts in real-world scenarios. I'll provide insights on solving everyday challenges that test automation engineers face, such as maintaining consistency, avoiding duplicated effort, and ensuring reliability at scale. The focus on scaling, collaboration, and reusability makes this session stand out from other test automation talks.

Summary — In this talk, he shared his journey of scaling test automation across teams and environments at Indeed. They started with a small, siloed effort and transformed it into a central framework that drastically reduced implementation time and improved efficiency across the organization. By making the framework reusable and scalable, they not only improved collaboration but also ensured consistency in quality across different applications.

Mesut delved into the intricacies of building scalable and reusable test automation frameworks. He mentioned that it’s important not only to implement a reusable framework but also to maintain it and teach team members how to use it effectively. He discussed the importance of separating different test cases (smoke, regression, automation), maintaining historical data of test executions, and choosing the right framework.

One example he gave is with Cypress which allows us to do one thing in several different ways. While this is okay, in order to build a reusable and future-proof framework, we need to pick the one which is serving our team's needs the best and use it team-wide.

The talk also covered the use of tools like Elastic and Kibana for monitoring test runs and the necessity of training teams on the implemented frameworks.
In his talk he emphasized on the fact that test coverage is not the only important stat - there are several other which need to be taken into account as well:

- Number of critical incidents
- Automation coverage
- Total regression test duration
- False failures
- Average test fix time
- Average test implementation time

![12:20 Roei Berkovich | Riverside.FM - Beyond the Hype: Facing Micro Frontend Challenges in Large-Scale](/images/blog/cityjs-athens-2025/6.jpeg)

Microfrontends bring flexibility and promise independence, yet when you're operating at scale, unseen challenges can emerge like icebergs on the horizon.

In this session, he took us through the twists and turns of the real-world saga with microfrontends. He showed us how his teams conquer common obstacles—synchronizing efforts, unifying our design, and managing our services dependencies. He did more than just telling tales; his team created an in-house tool that helps them deal with all these issues and clearly shows what's going on.

Roei explored the adoption of microfrontends, discussing their benefits and the challenges they present. Key points included the need for a unified user experience, design systems, documentation, versioning, and monitoring. He emphasized that while microfrontends offer flexibility, they require skilled teams and are best suited for large, complex applications.

He talked about how microfrontend architecture is not meant to be used in all teams and in all projects. He also emphasized on the tasks which should be addressed before even starting the microfrontend project:

- Roles and responsibilities - each service has its own codebase, code quality and testing CI and separate setup
- Each service should provide unified UX
    - Design System
    - Storybook
    - Documentation
    - Versioning
    - Theme colors, fonts, measurements
    - Isolated CSS
- Load time optimization
    - Tree shaking
    - Usage of bundle analyzers (bundlephobia)
    - Code splitting
    - Serving assets from a CDN
    - Sharing dependencies between services
    - Usage of HTTP/2
- Knowledge sharing
    - Different teams working on separate services need to share knowledge using meetings, sessions and discussions
- Usage of debugging and monitoring tools
    - Data RUM
    - Datadog
    - Dashboard insights
    - Client errors
    - Server errors
    - Budles sizes
    - User sessions

I had the opportunity to discuss a specific topic he talked about - the possibility to mix multiple frontend frameworks in one microfrontend architecture.

I asked him what kind of design system should be implemented in order to serve the needs of all chosen frontend frameworks in the team’s microfrontend architecture and his answer was that it should be planned before the start - the team can go for a design system based on Vanilla JS or Web components, or even React/Vue/Angular dummy components which serve the sole purpose of carrying the styling.

![13:40 Dan Neciu | Career OS - How not to end up your app to a hot mess of spaghetti Carbonara](/images/blog/cityjs-athens-2025/7.jpeg)

Every project / app starts small and grows and grows until it becomes a hot mess of spaggetti Carbonara. You try to follow all the best practices and advice and in the end the result is the same. In this talk he went though his case study on how he managed to scale his application to millions of users and keep the code tidy and clean.

Starting a startup is one thing - scaling it is another beast entirely. In this practical, experience-driven talk, he took us through his two-year journey of building and scaling a JavaScript application from ground zero. Rather than theoretical concepts, we heard real stories about the technical challenges they faced and the solutions the implemented. We discussd how to handle:

- building a component library
- building a scalable release process
- internationalisation of the app
- performance issues at scale
- security
- and some funny bugs

Dan shared insights into building a platform for students by students, introducing CareerOS. He discussed creating a common interface for third-party integrations using a facade pattern, developing a component library published on npm, and using Figma as the source of truth.

The talk covered topics like lazy loading with react.lazy, handling deployments, and implementing a “No broken windows” policy to maintain code quality.

Dan provided a list of task we should perform in order to stay away from spaggettifying our codebase:

- Figma (or any other design tool, actually) should be the single source of truth when it comes to design
- There should be a person who takes care of the components - Components Project Lead
- Storybook and CI/CD should be utilized to provide better understading of the component system and to elliminate issues
- Global imports for CSS/SCSS should be configured in our bundlers in order to reduce the repetitions and the bundle sizes
- Lazy loading and code splitting should be in place whenever possible
- Instead of chunk hash, our build tool should use our version (which means we should have versioning in place). This way possible preload/load errors will coming from service workers will be mitigated
- Preview deployments should be implemented for each branch (similar to how Vercel and Netlify do it)
- Release notes should be generated on each release

In this talk, he took us on a tour in Angular SSR. We saw how server side rendering has evolved over time in Angular. Then he gave us an overview of the latest SSR advancements and improvements in to the framework. Finally, we saw a quick demo how an Angular application can benefit from SSR.

Aristeidis delved into optimizing web applications using modern Angular techniques. He discussed Angular Server-Side Rendering (SSR), destructive hydration, and when to use SSR to improve core web vitals, optimize SEO, and enhance security.

The talk also covered Angular Static Site Generation (SSG) and its benefits for targeting low-end devices and serving static content. It is important to note that according to him SSR shouldn’t be used when you directly manipulate the DOM or if your templates have invalid syntax.

Aristeidis also said that SSG is really helpful if you target low end devices, poor network connectivity or if you serve static content.

Outside of work, Shelley loves to uncover hidden treasures at the flea market, eat the saltiest licorice humans can handle, and never misses the daily NYT crossword.

![15:20 Shelley Vohr | Microsoft - Trash Talk - Understanding Memory Management](/images/blog/cityjs-athens-2025/10.jpeg)

Memory management might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think about JavaScript and Node.js, but understanding it can unlock a whole new level of insight into how your code runs. In this talk, we took a closer look at how Node.js manages memory with Google's V8 engine and explored the fascinating process of garbage collection—how memory is reclaimed, what can go wrong, and how to spot and fix issues in your own code.

Through real-world examples, we demystified the different types of garbage collection, when they're used, and what happens when memory is mismanaged.

We also saw how these concepts connect directly to our JavaScript applications and learned practical strategies to write more efficient, reliable code.

In her talk Shelly explained how memory management works in programming and how it differs in the world of JavaScript. She dived deep into the topic of Garbage Collection - how it works, how JavaScript has it built-in but we still can implement techniques which will improve memory management and Garbage collection in our frontend applications.

She explained how V8 (the JS engine used in the Chromium browsers and in Node.js) uses memory management using the “mark-and-sweep” method and how it does that in parallel with the JS execution.

Then she explained how V8 collects the “garbage”, what a memory leak is and how to write code which doesn’t cause memory leaks. She also provided hints on how to write performant code using WeakMap, WeatSet and the FinalizationRegistry API all of which are part of the existing JavaScript APIs.

#### 15:50 Anna Henningsen | MongoDB - Segmentation fault! Low-level debugging for JS developers

Once one of the most active Node.js core contributors, Anna is still driven by a passion for JavaScript and its community. These days, she works on Developer Tools and Client Libraries at MongoDB.

![15:50 Anna Henningsen | MongoDB - Segmentation fault! Low-level debugging for JS developers](/images/blog/cityjs-athens-2025/11.jpeg)

JavaScript developers may not often face segmentation faults, but low-level debugging skills can be invaluable for diagnosing crashes and other issues in server-side JavaScript applications. This talk provided an overview of how native debuggers and tracing tools can help investigate issues that would otherwise be out of reach for JS developers, such as crashes or memory leaks that straddle the boundary between high-level JS code and native C or C++ APIs.

Anna went really deep into debugging Node.js applications using native debuggers such as `gdb`, `lldb` and `strace`. Her talk emphasized on usage of Linux but most of the tools are compatible with MacOS and even with Windows (after some configuration, of course).

Theodore is a software engineer working on Proxima Analytics and contributing to open-source projects. He enjoys writing about software and building web stuff. Sometimes, he travels to speak at conferences.

![15:50 Theodore Vorillas | Workable - Why Greek Motorcycle Drivers Are Not Wearing Helmets?](/images/blog/cityjs-athens-2025/12.jpeg)

If you have ever visited Greece, you may have noticed that the streets are flooded with motorbikes and scooters. You may also have noticed that many of the riders are not wearing any protective gear like jackets or helmets. In this talk, we explored how Theodore designed and built an IoT device that tracks and counts Greek riders who are not wearing helmets, using JavaScript and AI.

Theodore presented a project that uses Node.js, ffmpeg, and a Python image recognition library called YOLO to detect helmet usage among motorcycle drivers. The model, trained in Google Colab, runs on TensorFlow to process video streams and counts instances of helmet usage. To respect privacy, additional models blur faces and license plates. The system has been running for six months, analyzing an average of 3,000 motorcycles per day.

AI is everywhere, and Web AI usage in JavaScript on the front end is growing exponentially - but where is it going and how will this change websites of the future? In this talk we saw how one can use the latest generative AI models from Google that run entirely client side on the front end (no cloud) to perform agentic behaviors to get common tasks done faster than ever before on any website giving you an edge over your competition.

Jason, leading Web AI at Google, discussed the integration of AI into web applications. He showcased how client-side AI agents can enhance user experiences, enabling smarter interactions and paving the way for a more agentic internet. The talk emphasized the importance of combining technical and creative expertise to develop innovative prototypes.

### Conference Day 2 - May 31, 2025

#### 09:45 Douglas Crockford | JSON Creator - Keynote

Douglas Crockford is an American computer programmer who is involved in the development of the JavaScript language. He specified the data format JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), and has developed various JavaScript related tools such as the static code analyzer JSLint and minifier JSMin. He wrote the book JavaScript: The Good Parts, published in 2008, followed by How JavaScript Works in 2018. He was a senior JavaScript architect at PayPal until 2019, and is also a writer and speaker on JavaScript, JSON, and related web technologies.

![09:45 Douglas Crockford | JSON Creator - Keynote](/images/blog/cityjs-athens-2025/15.jpeg)

Most of our current programming languages are descended from Fortran and C. While they were important advancements in the 1950s and 1970s, they are crippled by the assumptions that were profoundly important at the time: memory was measured in kilobytes, and a program executed slowly in a single process in a single machine.

The descendant languages inherit this genetic weakness. We know that the languages we use are all deficient, so we keep adding features to them, but it seems there are never enough features. These languages will never be good enough.

In today's world, computers have literally a million times more memory than was available to C. That truth should excite us to consider designs that are free of the small memory constraint. In today's world, programs are distributed. They run in many machines simultaneously, in various tiers and services and clients and servers, some under our immediate control, some we know are not under our control, and some that we think are under our control but are not.

Our programming languages should be built specifically for this situation. Our focus on bloating the old languages distracts us from the more fruitful path of migrating to new languages that are designed explicitly for networking, with fine grained security at the foundation.

You should not be limited by your grandfather's language. You deserve something better. This talk suggested a possible way forward.

Mr. Crockford started by talking about the “Great Leaps” in programming languages:

- The Von Neumann architecture or the machine code
- Symbolic Assembly
- High level languages
- Structured programming (else instead of goto)
- Object-oriented programming
- Functional programming

Then he moved to a topic which exists since the 1970s - The Actor Model - what it is, how it works in theory and why it is the future of programming.

![The Actor Model by Douglas Crockford](/images/blog/cityjs-athens-2025/16.jpeg)

Finally he shared that he is working on a new programming language which will be based on the Actor Model - Misty - more about it on [its website](https://mistysystem.com).

![11:00 Evyatar Alush | Meta - Let's Build React Context From Scratch in JS](/images/blog/cityjs-athens-2025/18.jpeg)

In this talk, we explored the capabilities of React's Context API and learned how to use its powerful features outside of React to declutter our code, reduce bloat, and simplify our functions' signatures. We made use of JavaScript fundamentals to build this API from scratch, and by the end of the talk, we were able to use it in our vanilla JavaScript and node applications.

Evyatar provided a hands-on session on implementing React Context manually, offering a deeper understanding of its inner workings and use cases - he showed a live demonstration of how to implement the common `describe` and `test` functions which are provided by various testing libraries and he also explained that he uses the shown approach in his open-source form validation library called Vest.

In this hands-on session, we focused on transforming a mobile app (written with React Native) from using mocked data to fully utilizing cloud services like authentication, real-time data, file storage and generative AI. Through live coding, Salih demonstrated how to create our infrastructure and connect our application to AWS services. By the end of this talk, we had the skills to implement secure authentication, cloud-based data, storage, and add AI functionality to your mobile apps, enabling you to take your projects to the next level.

Salih demonstrated the process of transitioning from mocked data to fully integrated cloud-connected mobile applications using TypeScript, highlighting best practices and common pitfalls. He explained what full-stack development is and how one can utilize the tools provided by AWS in order to build a truly cloud-connected applications as a full-stack developer:

- AWS Cognito for authentication
- AWS Dynamo DB for database
- AWS Bedrock for AI models and gen-AI
- AWS S3 for storage
- AWS Amplify, which combines all of the above

![12:00 Erik Rasmussen | Attio - React Beyond the DOM](/images/blog/cityjs-athens-2025/20.jpeg)

In his talk, he explaind what it's like to build a React renderer and reconciler, what they are and how to use them. He did a live demo showing how React can be used to convert html to markdown. And then he demonstrated how React can render to the Real World, by controlling IOT devices.

In his talk, Erik explained how React is platform-agnostic and how it needs renderers in order to work in specific environments. He told us that we already know and use some the renderers - React DOM, React Native; but he went even further and explained that we can think outside the box and “render” React applications outside of the traditional environments.

One of the examples which he showed is an application which renders React components as Markdown.

The next example which he built in front of the audience was a traffic light simulator where he “rendered” react components on two smart light bulbs.

![13:30 Darko Bozhinovski | Supertokens - Future-proof your UI: Building with Web Components](/images/blog/cityjs-athens-2025/22.jpeg)

Do you love standards but hatehatehate the developer experience (DX) of web components? He too. As a reformed skeptic of Web Components due to his DX concerns, he encountered an interesting challenge at SuperTokens: creating a UI library that supports all the frameworks and remains future-proof.

After some research, he discovered that SolidJS compiles to Web Components, offering a familiar, React-like developer experience — exactly what he needed to become a believer. After a couple of rounds of experimentation, he fell in love with (the idea of) web components. This talk shares insights from his journey towards adopting Web Components for SuperToken’s next-gen authentication UI library and why web components are a great idea that’s here to stay.

Darko delved into the benefits of Web Components, discussing how they can be leveraged to create reusable and framework-agnostic UI elements.

He mentioned that in his particular use case he wasn't able to utilize the "Shadow DOM" API provided by the WebComponents specification but this doesn't apply to all of us.

He showed how using the `solid-element` library from NPM can help us build reusable and framework-agnostic web components utilizing everyday tools such as JSX.

![14:25 Matheus Albuquerque | Medallia - Hydration, Islands, Streaming, Resumability… Oh My](/images/blog/cityjs-athens-2025/24.jpeg)

Our ecosystem can be overwhelming! First, we had the rise of SSR and SSG—and each had its own gigantic pile of frameworks and tools. Then partial hydration enabled us to hydrate only some of our components on the client, which we've seen in React Server Components.

But what about islands? Do they relate at all to Streaming SSR? Moreover, what is resumability, and why do I keep hearing about it? […] Oh, did anyone say rendering on the Edge?

Well… There are many approaches out there, and all of them argue that their philosophy is best. In this session, we went over these architecture/rendering patterns, to help shed some light on how some are implemented and the concepts behind them.

Matheus presented advanced rendering techniques in modern web development, discussing concepts like hydration, island architecture, streaming, and resumability.

![15:50 Panagiotis Skias | Netcompany - JSONize your Forms: The Abstraction Dilemma](/images/blog/cityjs-athens-2025/26.jpeg)

This talk covered his first implementation (within the company) in an Angular Project – specifically, the creation of dynamic forms.

He began by highlighting the importance of forms in modern applications, and how different stakeholders – such as designers, business teams and developers – each bring their own perspective and requirements to the table.

From there, he introduced the business problem, outlining the specific requirements and constraints involved. He walked through his initial thought process: how he planned to approach the problem, what he aimed to achieve, and – just as importantly – what he wanted to avoid.

The core of the talk revolved around a key dilemma he faced: should he stick with Angular’s built-in form-building tools, or build something more abstract, flexible, and innovative? This dilemma represented a broader tension between concretion and abstraction. He wanted to strike a balance – to gain the benefits of both approaches while minimizing their downsides.

His first implementation attempted to walk that line, but as he looked further ahead, the limitations became clear. That led him to rethink his approach entirely. The turning point came with discovering Formly, an open-source Angular library for building dynamic, JSON-powered forms. He explained how he adopted Formly, how he integrated it into the project, and how it helped resolve the core challenges.

The talk concluded with a broader reflection on the potential of using JSON not just for dynamic forms, but as a powerful abstraction tool across other parts of an application.

#### 16:25 Dani Coll | Dynatrace - Multithreading in JavaScript

Dani is a Senior Software Engineer based in Barcelona working on platform apps at Dynatrace. He started his tech journey on a startup 9 years ago as a mobile developer, going through a couple more consultant companies in the process he finally specialised himself in frontend development.

As a Tech Evangelist he’s eager to share the lessons he learned with all of us.

![16:25 Dani Coll | Dynatrace - Multithreading in JavaScript](/images/blog/cityjs-athens-2025/27.jpeg)

Are you struggling with performance and you do not know what else you can try out?

JavaScript as a single threaded language is unable to maximise the full potential of our CPUs, but there might be a solution: Web Workers.

Dani explored the capabilities and limitations of multithreading in JavaScript, discussing how to effectively utilize Web Workers for concurrent processing.

He started with the fact that JavaScript is a single threaded language and the JavaScript rendering engines have several features which help us work in this single-threaded environment. He continued with an explanation on how the call stack works in JS, its quirks and specifications.

Then he talked about the WebWorker API which provides a way to spawn parallel processes and execute JavaScript code outside of the main thread.

He showed an implementation of a Chess game where he used the `js-chess-engine` library to calculate the next best move. As this library requires lots of resources to do its magic it usually blocks the main thread and the UI becomes stuck. Utilizing the power of WebWorkers he was able to move the heavy caclulations to another thread while the main thread continues to work as expected without blocking the rendering.

Finally he dived into the topic of Offscreen canvas and how it can be used to render large dataset in charts or graphs without blocking the UI.

Through a mix of audio, video, and live performance, Tony explored Web based AI tools in an attempt to convince the audience of their suitability for helping write hip hop lyrics. After a walkthrough and comparison of the main options, he put the best to the test in a crescendo we won't forget.

We walked away from this session with an understanding of the current state of browser based speech recongition, a starting point for integrating it into our web applications, and a new-found appreciation for how technology can amplify human creativity — one bar at a time.

Tony concluded the conference with an engaging session on the intersection of music and AI, demonstrating how neural networks can be applied to generate and analyze musical compositions.

He shared his attempt to use different APIs leveraging speech recognition in order to implement a script which recognises hip-hop lyrics. This was an interactive talk, actually the first one I ever attended, during which he engages the audience into actively participating while he concluded the event with an awesome hip-hop performance.
