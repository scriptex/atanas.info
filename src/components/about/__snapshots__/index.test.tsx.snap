            2010
          </h3>
          <p>
            My name is Atanas and I am a Senior JavaScript/TypeScript engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently located in Varna, Bulgaria. That's on the south-east side of Europe, on the Black Sea.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started my web development career in 2010 as a freelance apprentice to a hardcore fullstack web developer and pretty fast learned the basics of HTML and CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            We even had our own small web development company. In "HTML Lab" I was doing the front-end part and was mainly focused on slicing design files and turning them into static HTML pages.
          </p>

          <h3>
            2012
          </h3>
          <p>
            Between 2012 and 2018 I was employed in one of the largest web development companies in Varna, Bulgaria - 2create. In this company I worked for some of the biggest PSD-to-HTML brands out there - htmlBurger and htmlBoutique. I developed thousands (yes thousands) of different projects for clients from all over the globe and was focused on the front-end part of all projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the last 3 years of my employment there I was a direct assistant to several project managers and I also mentored several junior and intermediate front-end developers.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the period I participated in defining, integrating and teaching the internal coding standards in the company and co-authored the internal front-end projects starter template which was based on Webpack, Babel, PostCSS, SCSS and many more. The coding standards and Jarvis - that was the name of the front-end template - were (and are) used in tens of thousands of projects for clients from around the world.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h3>
            2014
          </h3>
          <p>
            During my employment between 2012 and 2018 I developed, integrated and maintained the internal build systems for the company. This included mastering CSS pre- and post-processors such as LESS, SASS/SCSS and PostCSS, task runners such as Gulp and Grunt, module bundlers such as Webpack and Rollup, and NodeJS which I used as a runtime.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along these technologies I mastered JavaScript and it became my preferred coding language. I also presented a keynote on the features introduced in 2015 with the 6th version of ECMAScript (the JavaScript standard).
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2017 I started learning TypeScript which later became the number one tool in my utilities belt. I prefer starting new projects entirely in TypeScript regardless of the targeted platform or end - Web/Native or front-end/back-end.
          </p>

            2018
          </h3>
          <p>
            Since the beginning of 2018 I am working as a JavaScript/TypeScript engineer in a small startup located in Varna and operating internationally.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Three 11 we are focused on providing the best possible quality while using bleeding edge technologies. We are working on several in-house projects along with some interesting client websites and applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            We prefer JavaScript and TypeScript and utilize their power when building applications using React, Angular, Vue, React Native and even static web sites or WordPress powered CMS websites and blogs.

            Today
          </h3>
          <p>
            Now I am a JavaScript and TypeScript engineer with more than 10 years of professional experience. I am focused on the front-end but using a lot of back-end technologies as well. My daily tasks include coding HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Bash and many more.
          </p>
          <p>
            The latest project I worked on is an award-winning, large, international IoT application for one of the world's largest investor-owned electric utility service providers which aims to provide users from all over Europe with the ability to control their homes' smart appliances and energy consumption.
